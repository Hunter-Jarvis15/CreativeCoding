            <h2><u>Self Portrait</u></h2>

                <p>
                    This is my self portrait. We began working Java Script to get this to work.<br>
                    We started out with creating simple shapes just by themselves and then slowly<br>
                    got them to be 'drawn' where we wanted them with the coordinates based on the<br>
                    size of our canvas. Once we were happy with how it looked, we were told to make<br>
                    some of the shapes move left and right, and up and down. They also had to be<br>
                    moving at varying speeds. We also got to change the colors of our shapes and of<br>
                    our canvas which added to the overall picture.
                </p>
            <h2><u>Game</u></h2>
            <IMG SRC="Game.JPG" ALIGN="top">
            <IMG SRC="Game 2.JPG" >
                <p>
                    This is my game. After our self portrait, we continued to build on our skills in java script.  <br>
                    The first thing we created was our canvas. We got to design it however we wanted, so I went <br>
                    with a blue and green color scheme for this. We then had to create a character, mine was a square,<br>
                    and then add some enemies to the game, the gray circles. We had to move the square around our canvas <br>
                    without dealing with collision between my character and enemies. Once I got my characterto move,<br>
                    I made an exit that when my character reached it, text appears and congratulates you on exiting the board.<br>
